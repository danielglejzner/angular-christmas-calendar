We express our gratitude to [Johnny Fekete](https://twitter.com/FullStackMaker) for his outstanding contributions to the development of the 'CSS Christmas Calendar,' serving as the inspiration for the creation of the 'Angular Christmas Calendar.'

[CSS Christmas Calendar](https://github.com/johnnyfekete/CSSChristmasCalendar) is an experiment with 24 festive CSS-art hidden under each day in the calendar.

Project we created isCommunity-driven summary
of #Angular events in 2024.

24 Guests.
24 Windows.
Each opening over 24 days.

Starting December 1st 2024.

A new window opens every day.
Leading up to Christmas Eve.

Each guest will share their personal insights on Angular as seen in 2024.
